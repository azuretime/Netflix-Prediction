Netflix Prediction
==============================

A python Flask web app that allows uploading a poster, entering the type of production, genre, rating, director, writer, awards received and nominated for to predict the popularity and quality of the movies and TV series. We deploy the prediction model as a real-time API service.

1. Install packages: `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

2. Run app: `python3 app.py`

3. Open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser

Important Files
------------

1. webapp folder

    The folder contains frontend design and supporting files

    a. model_webapp_dir: keep the model file
    b. static: keep css, js, images files
    c. template: contain html files

2. app.py and predict.py

   It implements the main backend logic
